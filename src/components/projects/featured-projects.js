        <h4><a href="https://bwcollex.netlify.app/">The Black and White Collection</a></h4>
        <p>
          The Black and White collection is a simple selection of black and
          white images from various photographers and artists on Unsplash. The
          purpose of this project was to explore with parallax scrolling and
          create a compose a layout that would sway towards uncommon yet
          pleasing.

        <h4>Puppert</h4>
        <p>
          Puppert is a productivity application that tracks the progress of user
          and team created development projects.
          <br />
          <br />
          I have found that other progress tracking applications are complex and
          have many features that are not utilized by many users. Puppert is
          made to have an easy-going user experience while having a
          comprehensive user interface. While on Puppert,
          users are able to track the progress of their projects while
          implementing some Agile methods. This includes the process of creating
          user stories and sprints.
          <br />

        <h3>School Projects</h3>
        <h4>Astronomical Learning</h4>
        <p>
          Astronomical Learning is a website for those interested in all things
          space who want to learn more about SpaceX and NASA missions and space
          itself. This project is also an informational system that will allow
          people of all ages to learn about SpaceX, NASA and space in a variety
          of ways.
          <br />
          <br />
          Visitors will be able to see what missions SpaceX and NASA have
          completed and be able to view various information about each mission.
          The website will also include other ways of teaching people about what
          goes into space missions and other aspects of space. Unlike SpaceXâ€™s
          launch manifest, our product will be able to deliver more detailed
          information about SpaceX missions and in a format that is more
          appealing to younger audiences alongside a much larger scope of
          topics.
