        <h4>The Black and White Collection</h4>
        <p>
          The Black and White collection is a simple selection of black and
          white images from various photographers and artists on Unsplash. The
          purpose of this project was to explore with parallax scrolling and
          create a compose a layout that would sway towards uncommon yet
          pleasing.

        <h4>Puppert</h4>
        <p>
          Puppert is a productivity application that tracks the progress of user
          and team created development projects.
          <br />
          <br />
          I have found that other progress tracking applications are complex and
          have many features that are not utilized by many users. Puppert is
          made to have an easy-going user experience while having a
          comprehensive and easy-to-understand user interface. While on Puppert,
          users are able to track the progress of their projects while
          implementing some Agile methods. This includes the process of creating
          user stories and sprints.
          <br />

        <h3>School Projects</h3>
        <h4>Astronomical Learning</h4>
        <p>
          This project is a website focused around teaching younger audiences
          about space related topics including our solar system, the universe,
          and missions conducted by major space related companies such as NASA
          and SpaceX. Our goal is to make the website as interesting and
          engaging as possible to our target audience.
          <br />
          <br />
          For those interested in all things space who want to learn more about
          SpaceX and NASA missions and space itself, the Astronomical Learning
          Website is an informational system that will allow people of all ages
          to learn about SpaceX, NASA and space in a variety of ways. Visitors
          will be able to see what missions SpaceX and NASA have completed and
          be able to view various information about each mission. The website
          will also include other ways of teaching people about what goes into
          space missions and other aspects of space. This will include
          interactive media such as games and quizzes. Unlike SpaceXâ€™s launch
          manifest (https:// www.spacex.com/missions), our product will be able
          to deliver more detailed information about SpaceX missions and in a
          format that is more appealing to younger audiences alongside a much
          larger scope of topics.
