      `Hello, I'm Josh! I'm an aspiring developer with years of experience in developing software and web applications. I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from Western Oregon University in 2020. Post-graduation, I was also able to work towards and earn my certificate of completion from The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp instructed by Dr. Angela Yu with the App Brewery. Since then, I have been involved in coding communities such as FreeCodeCamp and the App Brewery providing help to those learning software and web development.`,
      `As a developer, I do not like being stagnant. I am always striving to be a better developer than the day before. Being curious and self-motivated, I push myself to keep learning new things, expand my knowledge, and take on new challenges. I am passionate about what I do and thus, apply my energetic, yet determined personality, in the process of building applications and producing software with a creative mind.`
